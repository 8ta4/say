# Rationale

## 24/7

`say` is a tool designed for capturing thoughts and ideas through continuous voice recording. It's a personal reflection-focused tool that avoids any potential legal complications. 

Voice is an efficient medium for brain-to-computer communication. However, it may require some adaptation in your thought process. You might need to learn to verbalize every internal monologue and express yourself more coherently.

Prolonged speaking can strain your voice, and continuous speaking may require voice training. However, future technologies, such as lip reading, could potentially offer more efficient solutions.

`say` allows you to capture your thoughts in situations where traditional note-taking isn't feasible, such as when you're in bed or when your hands are occupied. 

To avoid contaminating your recordings, you might want to consider living alone or avoiding playing any songs or movies that could interfere with your recording. If you are married, consider getting a divorce.

Journaling can have therapeutic effects, and `say` automates this process, potentially providing catharsis.

`say` can boost your creativity and productivity by allowing you to record inspirations as they come. Whether it's a business idea, narrative, or comedic line, just say it.

## Accuracy

`say` aims to provide high-quality transcription for any user, but there are some limitations and challenges.

One of the challenges is dealing with low-confidence segments that the transcription system is not sure how to transcribe. To avoid contaminating the transcription with errors, `say` can drop these segments and only retain the ones with high confidence.

Another challenge is handling different accents and dialects. Currently, the most recognized accent is Standard American English, because it has the most data available for training the transcription system. This is a form of accentism.

To improve accuracy, users with non-standard accents can consider accent coaching, simpler diction, or avoiding complex or fancy vocabulary. This is similar to learning to touch-type to type faster. Technology will hopefully improve over time, and this adaptation may become unnecessary.

`say` aims to capture your thoughts anytime and anywhere, but common sense applies. If any human listener cannot understand you, `say` will probably struggle too.
