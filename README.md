## Just Say It

Whether you want to capture a fleeting thought, a raw emotion, or an unfiltered idea, just say it. Chronicle every essence of who you are with `say`.

## Setup

1. First off, you need Homebrew. If you don't have it already, you can find the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

1. Once you've got Homebrew, enter this command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   brew install 8ta4/say/say
   ```

1. You can do launch `say` by entering:

   ```sh
   say
   ```

1. You'll need a Deepgram API key to use `say`. If you don't have one yet, you can get it from the Deepgram website.

1. When `say` prompts you for the API key, just paste it in.

## Cost

`say` is free to use, but keep in mind that it uses the Deepgram API, which might cost you some money. You can check out the prices on [Deepgramâ€™s streaming pricing page](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

To help save money, `say` uses voice activity detection (VAD). This feature tries to cut down on unnecessary usage. But VAD may not be flawless.

## Usage

### Transcription

You can easily access recent transcriptions by opening "today".

You can navigate your transcription file using Neovim keyboard shortcuts.

### Recording

You might need to learn to verbalize every internal monologue and express yourself more coherently.

Prolonged speaking can strain your voice, and continuous speaking may require voice training.

To avoid contaminating your recordings, you might want to consider living alone or avoiding playing any songs or movies that could interfere with your recording. If you are married, consider getting a divorce.

To improve accuracy, you can consider accent coaching, simpler diction, or avoiding complex or fancy vocabulary. This is similar to learning to touch-type to type faster.

`say` aims to capture your thoughts anytime and anywhere, but common sense applies. If any human listener cannot understand you, `say` will probably struggle too.

### Encryption

We encourage you to use device-level encryption to protect your data.

### Backup

`say` gives you the freedom to choose your preferred backup or cloud storage method.
