## Goals

### 24/7

`say` is a tool designed for capturing thoughts and ideas through continuous voice recording. It's a personal reflection-focused tool that avoids any potential legal complications.

Voice is an efficient medium for brain-to-computer communication.

`say` allows you to capture your thoughts in situations where traditional note-taking isn't feasible, such as when you're in bed or when your hands are occupied.

Journaling can have therapeutic effects, and `say` automates this process, potentially providing catharsis.

`say` can boost your creativity and productivity by allowing you to record inspirations as they come. Whether it's a business idea, narrative, or comedic line, just say it.

### Accuracy

`say` aims to provide high-quality transcription for any user, but there are some limitations and challenges.

One of the challenges is handling different accents and dialects. Currently, the most recognized accent is Standard American English, because it has the most data available for training the transcription system. This is a form of accentism.

### Latency

`say` allows you to transcribe your speech into text quickly. You can use the transcription right away for your purposes, such as writing, editing, or sharing.

`say` is not designed to provide real-time feedback. It aims to let you express your thoughts without interruption or distraction.

To achieve fast transcription, `say` uses some existing APIs that offer low-latency transcription and topic segmentation. `say` does not need to create its own algorithms for these tasks.

`say` has a user interface that is optimized to reduce the perceived latency.

### Budget

Most productivity tools designed for individual users have a lower price than $100/month. I wanted to keep `say` affordable.

A high price point can motivate you to use `say` more often. You might think that since you are paying a lot, you should make the most of it and "just say it".

## Architecture

`say` functions as a monolithic macOS background process and also as a Neovim plugin. It's just a `brew install` away, eliminating the need for any additional devices.

The uniformity of the macOS ecosystem simplifies both development and testing.

By self-hosting `say`, you're enhancing your privacy.

## API Key

I've chosen not to store the API key. This approach keeps the codebase simple and reduces potential security vulnerabilities.

Designed for continuous operation, `say` ideally requires the API key to be entered just once.

## Name Overlap

This tool intentionally replaces the `say` command built-in with macOS.

If you run the default `say` command on macOS while this tool is active, it may interfere with the recording and transcription process.

I've chosen to keep the name of this tool as `say` to ensure a smooth installation and usage experience.

## Voice Activity Detection

To save on using the transcription API, `say` uses voice activity detection to eliminate silent periods.

## Transcription

The Interim Transcript (IT) is a real-time draft of ongoing speech.

Eventually, the IT will be transformed into the Final Transcript (FT).

To avoid contaminating the transcription with errors, `say` can drop low-confidence segments that the transcription system is not sure how to transcribe and only retain the ones with high confidence.

## Manual Edit

The Manual Edit (ME) feature lets you make changes to the transcript.

ME doesn't affect the IT. The start of the IT is marked by Neovim's extmark. Any changes you make before this mark will be saved, while any changes made after will not be saved. If you delete the extmark, the ME will not be saved.

## Segmentation

### Line

`say` displays each sentence on a separate line, a feature known as Automatic Line Segmentation (ALS).

`say` prioritizes interaction with the LLM over traditional readability for human readers.

### Paragraph

`say` analyzes topics and divides the last paragraph. When the subject matter of the text changes, `say` creates a new paragraph. This feature is known as Automatic Paragraph Segmentation (APS).

If the last paragraph is one or two sentences long, APS doesn't activate because you can navigate it using `j` and `k`. APS only activates if the paragraph is three sentences long or longer.

APS uses sentence embedding to split paragraphs. It identifies potential paragraph boundaries using sentence boundaries and then calculates the similarity of two new potential paragraphs using averaged embedding.

Each sentence's embedding is calculated and cached because calculating sentence embedding is computationally expensive.

### File

Daily segmentation speeds up loading times when using Neovim.

If you need weekly or monthly transcriptions, you can simply concatenate the daily transcriptions.

This also makes it easy to search for a specific date.

## Interaction

FT or ME triggers ALS. Once ALS is activated, it then triggers APS.

If a new FT or ME is introduced, any pending ALS and APS are cancelled because the previous ALS and APS may have been based on an outdated last paragraph.

## Data Retention

`say` doesn't keep a record of the audio once it has been transcribed.

The act of storing audio can amplify the observer effect, potentially making you more self-aware and uncomfortable.

By choosing not to store audio, `say` ensures that sounds like your snoring, farting, or moaning aren't kept on record.

Being arrested and having your own audio used against you in a court of law isn't a pleasant experience.

Even the sound of typing can sometimes be enough to decipher what you're typing. This becomes a security risk if you're entering sensitive information like passwords while speaking.

If you're interested in documenting everything, you might consider recording video. However, this comes with its own risks, such as accidentally capturing footage when you're nude.

## Backup

By storing the most frequently updated data separately, `say` doesn't continuously trigger cloud synchronization, even if you've set up `archive/` to be synced.

With a 10-minute archival interval, the risk of data loss is minimized to a manageable amount.

This 10-minute interval strategy might seem familiar to you as itâ€™s a widely adopted auto-save feature in many applications.
