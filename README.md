# say

## Just Say It

Whether you want to capture a fleeting thought, a raw emotion, or an unfiltered idea, just say it. Chronicle every essence of who you are with `say`.

## Usage

### Transcription

You can easily access recent transcriptions by opening "today".

You can navigate through sentences using `j` and `k`.

You can move between paragraphs using `{` and `}`.

### Recording

You might need to learn to verbalize every internal monologue and express yourself more coherently.

Prolonged speaking can strain your voice, and continuous speaking may require voice training.

To avoid contaminating your recordings, you might want to consider living alone or avoiding playing any songs or movies that could interfere with your recording. If you are married, consider getting a divorce.

To improve accuracy, you can consider accent coaching, simpler diction, or avoiding complex or fancy vocabulary. This is similar to learning to touch-type to type faster.

`say` aims to capture your thoughts anytime and anywhere, but common sense applies. If any human listener cannot understand you, `say` will probably struggle too.
