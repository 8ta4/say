# Rationale

`say` is a tool designed for capturing thoughts and ideas through continuous voice recording. It's a personal reflection-focused tool that avoids any potential legal complications. 

Voice is an efficient medium for brain-to-computer communication. However, it may require some adaptation in your thought process. You might need to learn to verbalize every internal monologue and express yourself more coherently.

Prolonged speaking can strain your voice, and continuous speaking may require voice training. However, future technologies, such as lip reading, could potentially offer more efficient solutions.

`say` allows you to capture your thoughts in situations where traditional note-taking isn't feasible, such as when you're in bed or when your hands are occupied. 

To avoid contaminating your recordings, you might want to consider living alone or avoiding playing any songs or movies that could interfere with your recording. If you are married, consider getting a divorce.

Journaling can have therapeutic effects, and `say` automates this process, potentially providing catharsis.

`say` can boost your creativity and productivity by allowing you to record inspirations as they come. Whether it's a business idea, narrative, or comedic line, just say it.
